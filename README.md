A simple script that creates a new image based on XOR value of every pixel of any two images.

Yes, you can XOR output image with any of the original input images and get the other original input image (if all images have the same dimensions).
If images have different dimensions, the output image will be XOR of the the first input image and resized second input image.

Usage: xorimg.py <*image 1*> <*image 2*> <*output image*>
